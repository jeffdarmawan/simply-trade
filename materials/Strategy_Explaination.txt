Using historical Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV) data from yfinance for all USD forex pairs, generate all available and known technical indicators or features for each forex pair. A machine learning algorithm will select the important technical features for each pair and use those features to train and predict the direction of each currency pair for the next period. Based on the predicted direction for the next period, we will buy or sell if the predicted direction changes accordingly.

All technical indicators (Trend, Momentum, Volatility, Candlesticks, Overlap, and Moving Averages) and technical statistics (e.g., entropy, kurtosis, skew) were included (using pandas_ta python library). Total number of features used was 185. LightGBM was selected as the machine learning algorithm due to its well-known reputation for speed and accuracy compared to other models. All USD currency pairs were used to generate technical features, as long as the data provided from yfinance during the selected period was consistent and had regular intervals.

LightGBM was trained using all technical features along with OHLCV data to predict the next close price return (percentage change between close price t+2 and t+1, where t is the current period). The total feature importance scores were computed across all currency pairs for each time interval. The 15 most important features were selected and used to train the model again.

The model then trained and tested its accuracy in predicting the price direction by splitting its in-sample data using a 5-period Time Series Split (Expanding Window). The least important feature was dropped, and the model was trained again. This process of dropping features and retraining continued until the model's accuracy dropped more than 1% from its highest score.
